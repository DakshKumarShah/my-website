                        <p>The Diu Fortress is a Portuguese-built fortification located on the west coast of India in Diu. The fortress was built as part of Portuguese India's defensive fortifications at the eastern tip of the island of Diu during the 16th century. The fortress, which borders on the town of Diu, was built in 1535 subsequent to a defense alliance forged by Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat and the Portuguese when Humayun, the Mughal Emperor attempted to annex this territory. It was strengthened over the years, till 1546. The Portuguese ruled over this territory from 1537 until the Indian invasion of December 1961. Today it is a landmark of Diu and one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World.</p>

                        <p>Indian Naval Ship Khukri was a frigate of the Indian Navy. During the Indo Pak War in 1971, she fell prey to three torpedoes fired by a Pakistan submarine on 9/12/1971 and sank 40 nautical miles off the coast of Diu taking down with her a crew of 18 Officers and 176 Sailors. Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla, Mahavir Chakra of the Indian Navy, the then Commanding Officer of the ship, chose to go down with the warship. The heroic act of Cap. Mulla and his valiant crew is shining example of unyielding spirit and indomitable courage glorifying the heist traditions of the Indian Navy. The INS Khukri Memorial was inaugurated on 15th December, 1999 and is found erected on the hillock at Chakratirth beach. It is a replica of the INS Khukri Naval Ship.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Daman and Diu was a union territory in northwestern India. With an area of 112 km, it was the smallest administrative subdivision of India on the mainland. The territory comprised two districts, Daman and Diu Island, geographically separated by the Gulf of Khambat. The state of Gujarat and the Arabian Sea bordered the territory. A Portuguese colony since the 1500s, these territories were taken over by India with the Annexation of Goa in 1961. Daman and Diu were administered as part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu between 1961 and 1987. After the Goa Opinion Poll, they became separate union territories. In 2019, a legislation was passed to merge the union territories of Daman and Diu with its neighbouring union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to form the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu with effect from 26 January 2020.</p>
