                        <p>Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh, is a reservoir at the foothills (Shivalik hills) of the Himalayas. This 3 km rain fed lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Shivalik Hills. Originally, the seasonal flow entered the lake directly, causing heavy siltation. To check the inflow of silt, 25.42 km2 of land was acquired in the catchment area and put under vegetation. In 1974, the Choe was diverted and made to bypass the lake completely, the lake being fed by three siltation pots, minimizing the silt into the lake itself.</p>
