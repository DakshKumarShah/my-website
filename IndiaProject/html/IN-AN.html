                            Andaman Islands. It is located 20 km from Rangat
                            adjacent to Andaman trunk road (ATR). Dhani Nallah
                            is named after a mangrove associate locally called
                            as Dhanipatti. The wooden boardwalk meandering
                            through mangrove creek for a distance of 713 m is
                            the main tourist attraction for the place.</p>

                        <p>The Limestone cave formations at Nayadera and the

                            attractions for tourists in Baratang. The island is
                            known for limestones, which deposit themselves
                            either above the soil or under the ground forming
                            interesting formations and layers. You can easily
                            get a boat at the Nilambur jetty, which will take
                            you to the famous caves. On the way, you can admire
                            scenic coastline covered with mangrove forests and
                            you even pass through mangrove-covered canals making
                            the ride more exciting.</p>

                        <p>A mud volcano or mud dome is a landform created by
                            the eruption of mud or slurries, water and gases.
                            Several geological processes may cause the formation
                            of mud volcanoes. Mud volcanoes are not true igneous
                            volcanoes as they do not produce lava and are not
                            necessarily driven by magmatic activity. Mud
                            volcanoes may range in size from merely 1 or 2
                            meters high and 1 or 2 meters wide, to 700 meters
                            high and 10 kilometers wide. Smaller mud exudations
                            are sometimes referred to as mud-pots.</p>

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territory of India
                    comprising 836 islands, of which only 31 are inhabited. The
                    islands are grouped into two main clusters: the northern
                    Andaman Islands and the southern Nicobar Islands, separated
                    by a 150 km (93 mi) wide channel. The capital and largest
                    city of the territory, Port Blair (officially Sri Vijaya
                    Puram), is located approximately 1,190 km (740 mi) from
                    Chennai and 1,255 km (780 mi) from Kolkata in mainland
                    India. The islands are situated between the Bay of Bengal to
                    the west and the Andaman Sea to the east. The northernmost
                    point is 901 km (560 mi) from the mouth of the Hooghly
                    River. Indira Point, located at 6°45'10″N and 93°49'36″E on
                    the southern tip of Great Nicobar, is the southernmost point
                    of India.</p>
