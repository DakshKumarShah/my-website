                        <p>The Ibrahim Rauza is a funerary complex featuring a mausoleum and a mosque, which are very similar in style, with a fountain between them. Following the example of many Indo-Islamic monuments, the complex is raised on a plinth within an enclosed gated space.  It was built in 1627 by Taj Sultana, the wife of Sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah II. It is located in Bijapur. The construction process reflects the magnificence of the building since it took more than eight years to finish. It is by far one of the most remarkable artistic achievements of the Adil Shahi dynasty, who established a Sunni Sultanate in Bijapur in the 15th century and ruled for almost two hundred years.</p>
